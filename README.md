## Project Workflow:
* Data Preprocessing: Missing values handling, categorical encoding
* Model Training: Comparing multiple classification models
* Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance analysis
This study highlights that Glucose, BMI, and Age are the most influential factors in predicting diabetes risk. Logistic Regression and XGBoost performed best, making them strong candidates for real-world application in diabetes risk assessment.
